# Finite Difference Method
## Application to 1D Consolidation

Code and excerpt from lecture notes demonstrating application of the finite difference method (FDM) to one-dimensional consolidation. The extracted lecture note is taken from a course I taught entitled Advanced Computational Methods in Geotechnical Engineering.
