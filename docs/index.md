## One-dimensional Consolidation

The partial differential equation governing one-dimensional consolidation is given by

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - c_\rmv \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} = 0
$$

where $ u $ is the excess pore water pressure, $ t $ stands for time, $ z $ represents depth and $ c_\rmv $ is the coefficient of consolidation which can be expressed as

$$
c_\rmv = \frac{k}{m_\rmv \gamma_\rmw}
$$

with $ k $ being the coefficient of permeability, $ m_\rmv $ the coefficient of volumetric compressibility and $ \gamma_\rmw $ the unit weight of water.
