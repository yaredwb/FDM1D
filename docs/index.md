## One-dimensional Consolidation

The partial differential equation governing one-dimensional consolidation is given by

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - c_v \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} = 0
$$

where $$ u $$ is the excess pore water pressure, $$ t $$ stands for time, $$ z $$ represents depth and $$ c_v $$ is the coefficient of consolidation which can be expressed as

$$
c_v = \frac{k}{m_v \gamma_w}
$$

with $$ k $$ being the coefficient of permeability, $$ m_v $$ the coefficient of volumetric compressibility and $$ \gamma_w $$ the unit weight of water.
